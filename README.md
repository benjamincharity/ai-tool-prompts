# AI Tool Prompts

A curated collection of specialized prompts for AI assistants to help with software development workflows, debugging, code auditing, and project management.

## Overview

This repository contains structured prompts designed to guide AI assistants through specific tasks in software development. Each prompt is crafted to provide consistent, thorough, and actionable results. All prompts are now in Markdown format (`.md`) for better readability and documentation.
